====================== CAR and CDR now 
return extra values. The function CAR n
ow returns two values.  Since it has to
 go to the trouble to figure out if the
 object is carcdr-able anyway, we figur
ed you might as well get both halves at
 once.  For example, the following code
 shows how to destructure a cons (SOME-
CONS) into its two slots THE-CAR and TH
E-CDR):         (MULTIPLE-VALUE-BIND (T
HE-CAR THE-CDR) (CAR SOME-CONS) ...) Fo
r symmetry with CAR, CDR returns a seco
nd value which is the CAR of the object
.  In a related change, the functions M
AKE-ARRAY and CONS have been fixed so t
hey don't allocate any storage except o
n the stack.  This should hopefully hel
